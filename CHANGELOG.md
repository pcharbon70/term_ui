## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-26

TermUI 1.0 establishes the pre-rewrite architecture as the stable release line,
including the Raw, TTY, and SSH backends, the Elm-style runtime, differential
rendering, constraint-based layouts, and the complete widget set.

### Added

- SSH backend support for remote terminal sessions.
- Bracketed-paste parsing into dedicated paste events.
- Root startup commands and table refresh APIs.
- Cross-platform terminal testing checklists.

### Changed

- Improved raw terminal output, resilience, and cleanup.
- Moved input polling outside the runtime process.
- Added terminal-output run coalescing and linear-time buffer diffing.
- Improved Markdown rendering and example consistency.
- Upgraded MDEx to a security-maintained release and removed an unused
  development dependency that pinned vulnerable HTTP client packages.
- Added dependency-vulnerability auditing to release CI.

### Fixed

- Constraint tuples in horizontal and vertical stacks now allocate and clip
  children as documented.
- macOS Option+Delete no longer stalls the escape-sequence buffer and performs
  word deletion in text inputs.
- Concurrent SSH runtimes now use isolated render buffers and avoid mutating
  local terminal global state.
- Terminal resize rendering and shutdown races.
- ANSI style restoration after reset operations.
- WSL/ConPTY and IEx terminal cleanup behavior.
- Shift+Tab parsing across CSI variants.
- Background-color bleeding and overlay rendering artifacts.
- Elixir 1.18 regular-expression compilation.
- Safe `stty` execution when no controlling terminal is available.
- Pre-OTP 28 systems now stay on the TTY/`stty` path instead of invoking the
  OTP 28 native raw/cooked shell-mode contract.
- Order-dependent tests, singleton cache lifecycles, documentation links, and
  static-analysis contracts required for a reproducible release build.

### Known limitations

- Native Windows console support is experimental. TermUI 1.0 does not configure
  Win32 console modes or implement native raw input and resize handling; use WSL
  where practical and validate the chosen terminal environment.
- A resume or external terminal redraw may require `TermUI.Runtime.force_render/1`.

  - ProcessMonitor - BEAM process introspection and monitoring
  - SupervisionTreeViewer - OTP supervision hierarchy visualization
  - ClusterDashboard - Distributed cluster node visualization and monitoring
  - TextInput - Single-line and multi-line text input with cursor navigation

- **Backend Abstraction**

  - TTY backend for line-based terminals
  - Test backend for unit testing
  - Automatic backend selection based on terminal capabilities
  - Character set selection (Unicode/ASCII) with graceful degradation

- **Rendering**
