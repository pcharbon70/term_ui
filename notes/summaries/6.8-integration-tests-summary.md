# Summary: Section 6.8 - Integration Tests

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive integration tests for TermUI that validate advanced widgets, developer tools, and the testing framework working together in realistic scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **`test/term_ui/integration/advanced_widgets_test.exs`**
   - Tests Table widget with large datasets (100-1000 rows)
   - Tests Tabs widget initialization and rendering
   - Tests Dialog widget with visibility states
   - Tests visualization widgets (BarChart, Sparkline, Gauge)
   - Tests scrollable widgets (Viewport, Canvas)

2. **`test/term_ui/integration/dev_workflow_test.exs`**
   - Tests inspector toggle functionality
   - Tests component boundary rendering with UIInspector
   - Tests component selection for inspection
   - Tests StateInspector state tree rendering
   - Tests state change detection
   - Tests PerfMonitor FPS calculation and memory tracking
   - Tests HotReload tracking
   - Tests complete dev mode cycle workflow

3. **`test/term_ui/integration/testing_framework_test.exs`**
   - Tests TestRenderer text and style capture
   - Tests snapshot comparison and diff detection
   - Tests EventSimulator key and mouse events
   - Tests typing simulation with modifiers
   - Tests shortcut simulation (copy, undo, redo)
   - Tests assertion helpers (text, style, state)
   - Tests ComponentHarness mounting, rendering, and event processing
   - Tests integration between test utilities

### Test Coverage

- **45 tests total** (44 passing, 1 intentionally skipped)
- Tests cover realistic usage scenarios
- End-to-end functionality validated
- All integration tests pass

### Technical Notes

- Stateful widgets (Table, Tabs, Dialog, Viewport, Canvas) use `new()` -> `init()` -> `render(state, area)` pattern
- Stateless visualization widgets (BarChart, Sparkline, Gauge) use direct `render(opts)` calls
- DevMode tests run with `async: false` due to shared named GenServer
- on_exit callbacks use try/catch to handle race conditions

## Success Criteria Met

1. All integration tests pass
2. Tests cover realistic usage scenarios
3. Tests validate end-to-end functionality
4. Full test suite continues to pass

## Test Results

```
45 tests, 0 failures, 1 skipped
```

The skipped test is for hot reload which requires complex module reloading that is impractical in test environment.
