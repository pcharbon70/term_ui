# Feature Plan: Section 6.8 - Integration Tests

## Problem Statement

TermUI needs integration tests that validate advanced widgets and developer tools working together in realistic scenarios. Unit tests verify individual components, but integration tests ensure the complete system works as expected.

**Impact:** Integration tests provide confidence that:
- Complex UI patterns work correctly
- Development workflow features function properly
- Testing framework utilities are reliable

## Solution Overview

Implement integration tests covering three areas:
1. **Advanced Widget Testing** - Tables, tabs, dialogs, charts in realistic scenarios
2. **Development Workflow Testing** - Inspector, hot reload, performance monitoring
3. **Testing Framework Validation** - Verify test utilities work correctly

### Key Design Decisions
- Tests use the new testing framework from section 6.7
- Tests simulate realistic user interactions
- Tests verify end-to-end behavior, not just isolated units

## Technical Details

### File Locations
- `test/term_ui/integration/advanced_widgets_test.exs` - Widget integration tests
- `test/term_ui/integration/dev_workflow_test.exs` - Development workflow tests
- `test/term_ui/integration/testing_framework_test.exs` - Testing framework validation

### Dependencies
- Testing framework from section 6.7
- All advanced widgets from Phase 6
- Development mode tools from section 6.6

## Implementation Plan

### Task 6.8.1: Advanced Widget Testing
- [x] 6.8.1.1 Test table with 1000 rows virtual scrolling and selection
- [x] 6.8.1.2 Test tabs switching with dynamic content loading
- [x] 6.8.1.3 Test dialog form with validation and submission
- [x] 6.8.1.4 Test chart rendering with real-time data updates

### Task 6.8.2: Development Workflow Testing
- [x] 6.8.2.1 Test inspector toggle shows/hides component boundaries
- [x] 6.8.2.2 Test hot reload updates component behavior
- [x] 6.8.2.3 Test state preservation across hot reload
- [x] 6.8.2.4 Test performance metrics display correctly

### Task 6.8.3: Testing Framework Validation
- [x] 6.8.3.1 Test test renderer matches actual render output
- [x] 6.8.3.2 Test event simulation produces expected state changes
- [x] 6.8.3.3 Test assertions detect both passing and failing conditions
- [x] 6.8.3.4 Test component harness isolates components correctly

## Success Criteria

1. All integration tests pass
2. Tests cover realistic usage scenarios
3. Tests validate end-to-end functionality
4. Full test suite continues to pass

## Notes/Considerations

- Some tests may need to be tagged for slower execution
- Hot reload tests may need special handling in test environment
- Performance tests should verify behavior, not exact timing
